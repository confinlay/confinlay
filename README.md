### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student with a deep interest in machine learning, cryptography, and distributed systems.

As a passionate developer, I like to develop simple side projects to demonstrate my ideas whenever I think of a feature for one of my favourite platforms. One I'm currently highlighting is "Star Players," a feature designed to reduce playlist redundancy in digital music platforms by allowing users to dynamically manage their favorite tracks. Feel free to check it out in my pins below!

There, you'll also find a collection of repositories that showcase projects from my academic coursework over the past two years. My pinned projects include "P2P-Network-Model" and "TravelMate", each developed last year at my home university, Trinity College Dublin. Additionally, "TrainBookingApp", "computer-vision", and "CTF-report" were completed during my current exchange at KU Leuven, as part of their Master's program in Computer Science.

With one more year until I graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, I'm eager to gain more practical experience. I'm open to both small-scale projects and open-source collaborations, as well as more significant internship opportunities. Feel free to reach out with any ideas or opportunities!

Looking forward to collaborating with you!
