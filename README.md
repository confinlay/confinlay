# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a final-year Computer Engineering master's student with startup experience and a strong interest in AI research.

## Research Focus

I am currently doing research into Bayesian deep learning, focusing on interpreting the uncertainty estimates provided by Bayesian Neural Networks. I am working on leveraging Hybrid Bayesian Neural Networks to make an existing method of explaining uncertainty far more performant. You can observe my progress on this here: [Hybrid-CLUE repository](https://github.com/confinlay/Hybrid-CLUE)

## Projects

In my other pinned repositories, you'll find projects I've completed as part of my university coursework over the years, including work on distributed systems, machine learning, and embedded systems.

## Future Opportunities

I am graduating in 2025 and am actively seeking roles as an AI Research Engineer/Software Engineer, whether it be full-time positions, internships, or short-term research roles. Feel free to reach out!
