### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student with a deep interest in machine learning, cryptography, and distributed systems.

A project I'm currently highlighting here is ["Star Players"](https://confinlay.github.io/home/), a feature idea I had which aims to reduce playlist redundancy in digital music platforms by allowing users to dynamically manage their favorite tracks. Feel free to take a look by clicking on the link above, or check out the repo [here](https://github.com/confinlay/confinlay.github.io)!

In my pinned repos, you'll also find a collection of repositories that showcase projects from my academic coursework over the past two years. My projects include a [peer to peer network model](https://github.com/confinlay/P2P-Network-Model), a [travel app](https://github.com/confinlay/TravelMate), and a [morse code game](https://github.com/confinlay/MorseCodeGame) played on an arduino microcontroller, all developed last year at my home university, Trinity College Dublin. Additionally, I completed a distributed [train booking system](https://github.com/confinlay/TrainBookingApp), a [short video](https://github.com/confinlay/computer-vision) demonstrating computer vision techniques, and a [CTF-style hacking project](https://github.com/confinlay/CTF-report) during my current exchange at KU Leuven, as part of their Master's program in Computer Science.

With one more year until I graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, I'm eager to gain more practical experience. I'm open to both small-scale projects and open-source collaborations, as well as more significant internship opportunities. Feel free to reach out with any ideas or opportunities!
